## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## How It Works...

```
AT the landing page for this quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer the question
    THEN a message is displayed to indicate if it was correct or wrong
        IF I answer a question incorrectly
        THEN time is subtracted from the clock
THEN I am presented with another question       
WHEN all questions are answered OR the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN I submit my initials
THEN they are locally stored along with my score
WHEN I am on highscores page
THEN I can selected to clear my score or go back and restart the quiz
